## 0.1.0 (Unreleased)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

* You can now specify `region` in the provider block. All resources will inherit this region setting, or you can override it in the resource-level `region`. Make sure to do a `plan` before an `apply` to make sure the resource is not destroyed due to incorrectly determining the region! If you see this happening, either explicitly set the `region` in the resource or use `lifecycle.ignore_changes`. 
* `floating_ip` has been removed from `openstack_compute_instance_v2`. You must now use `openstack_compute_floatingip_associate_v2` to associate a Floating IP with an Instance.
* `volume` has been removed from `openstack_compute_instance_v2`. You must now use `openstack_compute_volume_attach_v2` to attach a Volume with an Instance.
* `member` has been removed from `openstack_lb_pool_v1`. You must now use `openstack_lb_member_v1` to add a LBaaS v1 Member to a Pool.


IMPROVEMENTS:

* Can specify `region` in the provider [GH-25]

BUG FIXES

* Wait for LoadBalancer to be active before creating Pools and Monitors [GH-29]
* Choose first network found with a matching name for compute instances [GH-36]
