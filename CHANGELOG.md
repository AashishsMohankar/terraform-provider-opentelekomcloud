## 0.2.1 (Unreleased)

IMPROVEMENTS:

* `openstack_lb_loadbalancer_v2` timeouts have been lowered to 10 and 5 minutes [GH-74]

BUG FIXES:

* `openstack_images_image_v2` data source now sorts images by `CreatedAt` instead of `UpdatedAt` [GH-78]
* `openstack_networking_secgroup_v2` now re-reads security group before deleteing rules when `delete_default_rules => true` [GH-82]

## 0.2.0 (August 14, 2017)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

* Network detection in the `openstack_compute_instance_v2` resource was cleaned up and updated. There should be no incompatibilities, but you should do a `plan` before `apply` just to be safe.
* The `openstack_lb_loadbalancer_v2.provider` argument has been removed entirely. This was an erroneous argument from the beginning, so it should not be in use. However, if you do have it set in your configurations, please rename it to `loadbalancer_provider`.

FEATURES:

* __New Resource:__ `openstack_identity_project_v3` ([#50](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/50))
* __New Resource:__ `openstack_identity_user_v3` ([#52](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/52))

IMPROVEMENTS:

* `openstack_compute_instance_v2` now supports Neutron for network detection ([#39](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/39))
* `openstack_compute_instance_v2` support for multiple NICs on the same network ([#39](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/39))
* Added support for `TERMINATED_HTTPS` protocol in `openstack_lb_listener_v2` ([#49](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/49))
* Improvements to LBaaS v2 resource coordination ([#59](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/59))
* `openstack_lb_loadbalancer_v2.provider` has been removed. See notes above. ([#65](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/65))

BUG FIXES:
* `openstack_lb_pool_v2` handling of `persistence` updated, `cookie_name` is now optional. ([#57](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/57))
* `openstack_fw_firewall_v1.associated_routers` is now computed. ([#53](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/53))
* All `openstack_fw_rule_v1` attributes are now passed during an update phase. ([#53](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/53))
* `openstack_networking_secgroup_v2` now correctly updates description. ([#60](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/60))
* `openstack_fw_firewall_v1` now correctly translates `value_specs` on create. ([#66](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/66))

## 0.1.0 (June 21, 2017)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

* You can now specify `region` in the provider block. All resources will inherit this region setting, or you can override it in the resource-level `region`. Make sure to do a `plan` before an `apply` to make sure the resource is not destroyed due to incorrectly determining the region! If you see this happening, either explicitly set the `region` in the resource or use `lifecycle.ignore_changes`. 
* `floating_ip` has been removed from `openstack_compute_instance_v2`. You must now use `openstack_compute_floatingip_associate_v2` to associate a Floating IP with an Instance.
* `volume` has been removed from `openstack_compute_instance_v2`. You must now use `openstack_compute_volume_attach_v2` to attach a Volume with an Instance.
* `member` has been removed from `openstack_lb_pool_v1`. You must now use `openstack_lb_member_v1` to add a LBaaS v1 Member to a Pool.


IMPROVEMENTS:

* Can specify `region` in the provider ([#25](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/25))

BUG FIXES

* Wait for LoadBalancer to be active before creating Pools and Monitors ([#29](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/29))
* Choose first network found with a matching name for compute instances ([#36](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/36))
